The meeting\\nreviewed the latest scienti ﬁcﬁndings and identi ﬁed and prioritized the global activities necessary to prevent,\\nmanage and control the disease. Critical needs for research and technical guidance identi ﬁed during the meeting\\nhave been used to update the WHO R&D MERS-CoV Roadmap for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines and a\\nbroader public health research agenda. Since the 2017 meeting, progress has been made on several key actions in\\nanimal populations, at the animal/human interface and in human populations. This report also summarizes thelatest scienti ﬁc studies on MERS since 2017, including data from more than 50 research studies examining the\\npresence of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels.\\n1. Background: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\\nSince its identi ﬁcation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) ( Zaki\\net al., 2012 ) and Jordan ( Hijawi et al., 2013 ) in 2012, Middle East\\nRespiratory Syndrome (MERS) has become a global public health\\nthreat. Typical of an emerging zoonosis, Middle East respiratory syn-\\ndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has an animal reservoir, i.e. dromedary\\ncamels in which the virus causes little to no disease ( Mohd et al., 2016 ).\\nMany details about the extent of circulation and the mechanisms oftransmission within dromedary camel herds, or factors related to zoo-\\nnotic transmission and di ﬀerences in circulating MERS-CoV strains,\\nremain unknown. The virus has repeatedly spilled over from dromedary\\ncamels to humans, principally in countries on the Arabian Peninsula,\\ncausing signi ﬁcant morbidity and mortality ( World Health\\nOrganization, 2017a ;Azhar et al., 2014 ). Clusters of cases in the\\ncommunity and among family members are rare ( World Health\\nOrganization, 2017a ;Drosten et al., 2014 ). However, delays in diag-\\nnosis in hospitals has sometimes led to secondary cases among health\\ncare workers, patients sharing rooms or family members as a result ofunprotected direct contact with a patient before isolation. This human-to-human transmission in health care facilities can sometimes be am-\\npliﬁed, causing very large outbreaks, as has been seen in the Middle\\nEast and in the Republic of Korea, with signi ﬁcant public health and\\neconomic impacts ( Hijawi et al., 2013; Assiri et al., 2013 ;Al-Abdallat\\net al., 2014; Drosten et al., 2015 ;Al Hosani et al., 2016; Ki, 2015 ;Park\\net al., 2015 ). As of August 2018, more than 2249 human cases from 27\\ncountries have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO)\\n(World Health Organization, 2017a ).\\nThe FAO, OIE and WHO Tripartite have regularly brought together\\naﬀected member states, public health and animal o ﬃcials, and aca-\\ndemics to discuss what is known and unknown about the zoonotic\\norigin of MERS-CoV ( World Health Organization, 2016 ;FAO, 2016,\\n2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2013a ). The\\npurposes of these meetings and workshops have been to advocate for\\nmore surveillance and research on MERS-CoV in animals and humans,\\nto share information about how MERS-CoV is transmitted between\\nanimals, from animals to humans and between humans, to describe the\\ndiseases it causes, and to develop policies and guidelines for detection,\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.09.002\\nReceived 30 August 2018; Accepted 4 September 2018∗Corresponding author.

In addition, a number of countries in the Arabian Peninsulaand in Africa have engaged in research activities and surveillance of\\ncamel populations to shed light on the wider distribution of this virus or\\ninvestigate transmission patterns and routes for viral shedding. As a\\nfollow-up to previous meetings ( World Health Organization, 2016;\\nFAO, 2016 ,2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean,\\n2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2013b,\\n2013c ), FAO, OIE and WHO Tripartite held a Global Technical Meeting\\non MERS-CoV with representatives from Ministries of Health and\\nMinistries of Agriculture, subject matter experts, researchers, funders\\nand industrial partners from 25 to 27 September 2017 in Geneva,\\nSwitzerland (see Supplementary Information )(World Health\\nOrganization et al., 2017). The objectives were to review the latestscienti ﬁc evidence on MERS-CoV, further enhance cross-sectoral colla-\\nboration and communication during preparedness and response activ-ities, and identify research priorities given the advancements in our\\nknowledge.\\nWith 130 participants, this was the largest MERS-CoV Technical\\nMeeting to date and the ﬁrst meeting attended by representatives from\\nboth a ﬀected and at risk countries. That is, countries which have re-\\nported human infection, countries with evidence of MERS-CoV in dro-\\nmedary camels but no reported human cases, and countries at risk for\\nimportation (countries without infected camels that have close ties to\\naﬀected countries through expatriate workers, travel to a ﬀected coun-\\ntries for medical procedures and/or frequent international travel).\\n2. Findings from the global technical meeting\\nThere is strong consensus among all stakeholders that dromedary\\ncamels are the main source of transmission to humans. In 2014, OIE\\nidentiﬁed MERS-CoV as an emerging disease with zoonotic potential in\\ncamels and thereby creating expectations of reporting positive camelsby countries ( OIE, 2014a ) and recently published a MERS-CoV case\\ndeﬁnition ( OIE, 2017) for the reporting of con ﬁrmed and suspected\\ninfection in camels.\\nNot all countries face the same risks. For example, countries that\\nhave the infected reservoir (dromedary camels) di ﬀer from those\\ncountries in which dromedary camels show no evidence of current orpast infection ( Fig. 1). There may also be di ﬀerences in spillover po-\\ntential in countries with documented zoonotic transmission, comparedto those without, due to several factors including potential di ﬀerences\\nin husbandry practices, cultural, social, medicinal, occupational ex-posures, prevalence of underlying chronic medical conditions, or ge-\\nnetic factors in human populations, and MERS-CoV viral di ﬀerences\\n(Wong et al., 2015 ). As such, technical and risk mitigation guidance to\\nprotect human health and research priorities di ﬀer by region.\\nTheﬁndings from\\nthe Global Technical Meeting are summarized\\nbelow:\\ni. Surveillance needs: Surveillance in animals and humans to limit\\nzoonotic transmission\\nRoutine human surveillance for MERS-CoV in KSA ( Abdulaziz et al.,\\n2017 ) and throughout the Middle East has improved since the identi-\\nﬁcation of the virus in humans in 2012, but there is signi ﬁcant variation\\nin the quality and extent of surveillance between countries. In otherparts of the world, surveillance is limited. Since it is known that MERS-\\nCoV is enzootic in areas of Africa and Asia where dromedary camels are\\nfound, heighted awareness and surveillance for zoonotic MERS isrequired. This is currently lacking and remains a knowledge gap.\\nOne exception is the notable e ﬀort to identify potential MERS-CoV\\ninfection among pilgrims travelling back from the Middle East. Since2012, event-based surveillance among pilgrims returning from Hajj,\\nUmrah and other religious events in KSA has been conducted by KSA\\nand countries sending pilgrims. While many return reporting re-\\nspiratory symptoms, no MERS-CoV infections have been identi ﬁed\\namong returning pilgrims ( Muraduzzaman et al., 2018 ;Barasheed\\net al., 2014 ;Atabani et al., 2016; Koul et al., 2017; Annan et al., 2015;\\nMa et al., 2017 ;Memish et al., 2014a ,2014b ;Refaey et al., 2017; Al-\\nAbdallat et al., 2017 ;Matthew et al., 2015 ;Alqahtani et al., 2016; Win\\net al., 2016 ;Yavarian et al., 2018; Kapoor et al., 2014 ).\\nAmong animals, ﬁeld surveys conducted to date have included\\nseveral domestic and wildlife species including dromedary camels(Camelus dromedarius ) and Bactrian camels ( Camelus bactrianus ), goats,\\nbats, cattle, sheep, chickens, swine, ducks, bu ﬀalo and equids. Field\\nstudies in dromedary camels have been conducted in a number of\\ncountries ( Table 1). To date, MERS-CoV RNA or MERS-CoV-speci ﬁc\\nantibodies have been identi ﬁed in dromedary camels a number of\\ncountries ( Table 1) except Australia ( Hemida et al., 2014), Kazakhstan\\n(Miguel et al., 2016 ), and the Netherlands ( Reusken et al., 2013a ).\\nOther livestock such as alpacas ( Vicugna pacos ), llamas ( Llama pacos ),\\nyoung goats, rabbits and pigs have been shown to be susceptible to\\nexperimental infection ( Crameri et\\n al., 2016 ;Adney et al., 2016;\\nVergara-Alert et al., 2017).\\nDespite improvements, routine surveillance in dromedary popula-\\ntions is limited. The lack of surveillance information about MERS-CoVcirculation in dromedary camels restricts our understanding of the\\ntransmission dynamics and epidemiology in dromedary camel popula-\\ntions. Meeting participants agreed that surveillance should be in-\\ntegrated into existing surveillance systems, particularly in at-risk\\ncountries, similar to One Health approaches developed for avian in-\\nﬂuenza, and existing human respiratory disease surveillance systems set\\nup for in ﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infections\\n(SARI).\\nCurrently, a limitation in our ability to mitigate spillover from\\ndromedary camels to humans is a lack of clarity on the mode(s) oftransmission between dromedary camels and humans, the extent and\\nepidemiology of MERS-CoV circulation in dromedary camels in large\\nparts of Africa and South Asia, and on why zoonotic transmission is\\nlimited across Africa, large parts of the Middle East, and some parts of\\nSouth Asia despite high seroprevalence in dromedary camels ( Chu\\net al., 2018 )(Table 1).\\nFAO has outlined the meeting participants conclusions on priorities\\nfor MERS-CoV surveillance and management of PCR positive dro-medary camels, coordinated outbreak investigation of community ac-\\nquired cases with dromedary exposure, testing of animals at quarantine\\nand entry points, food safety and environmental contamination, risk\\ncommunication and awareness raising for MERS-CoV among animal\\nowners and intersectoral collaboration and coordination in an updated\\nDoha Declaration ﬁrst published in 2015 ( FAO, 2015 ) (REF/hyperlink).\\nIn dromedary camels, longitudinal studies to evaluate the natural his-tory, shedding pro ﬁle and immunity were highlighted as key research\\npriorities. Meeting participants agreed that further understanding ofdiﬀerences in viral strains and transmission dynamics, including the\\nrole of immunity in acquiring infection and shedding virus, the geo-graphic range of spillover events, and environmental, behavioral or\\nhost-related risk factors for zoonotic transmission should be prioritized.\\nii. Research needs: Hospital transmission and infection prevention and\\ncontrol\\nCountries face signi ﬁcant challenges in the early identi ﬁcation and\\ndiagnosis of MERS in humans due to the non-speci ﬁcity of clinical\\nsymptoms ( Arabi et al., 2017a ;TheS-Coesearch, 2013; Arabi et al.,\\n2017b ;Al-Taw ﬁq et al., 2017; Al-Taw ﬁq and Hinedi, 2018 ;Hui et al., ).R. Aguanno et al. Antiviral Research 159 (2018) 35–44\\n36The spectrum of illness ranges from no symptoms (or asymptomatic\\ninfection) to severe disease including pneumonia, acute respiratory\\ndisease syndrome, organ failure and death, with a case fatality ratio\\n35.5% among reported cases ( World Health Organization, 2012). The\\ndelay in identi ﬁcation and recognition of signs and symptoms compa-\\ntible with MERS and delay in early isolation of patients has reduced the\\nability to prevent transmission between people in health care settings,\\nnotably in emergency departments, cardiac care centers and renal\\ndialysis units ( Hijawi et al., 2013 ;Assiri et al., 2013 ;Al-Abdallat et al.,\\n2014 ;Drosten et al., 2015 ;Al Hosani et al., 2016 ;Ki, 2015 ;Park et al.,\\n2015 ;Ahmed et al., 2018; Amer et al., 2018).\\nOur understanding of human-to-human transmission in health care\\nsettings has improved through experimental and observational studies\\nconducted in countries during such outbreaks. For example, studies of\\nrespiratory pathogens ( Yu et al., 2007 ;Tran et al., 2012 ;Thompson\\net al., 2013) and MERS-CoV conducted in the Middle East ( Assiri et al.,\\n2013 ;Oboho et al., 2015 ;Hunter et al., 2016; Balkhy et al., 2016 ) and\\nthe Republic of Korea ( Bin et al., 2016 ;Kim et al., 2016a ,2016b ;Nam\\net al., 2017) illustrate that aerosol-generating procedures and non-in-\\nvasive ventilation, combined with inappropriate infection prevention\\nand control practices and lack of adherence to standard practices had\\nan important role in facilitating human-to-human transmission in\\nhealth care settings. The role of environmental contamination has been\\nevaluated in a number of hospitals following the 2015 outbreak in the\\nRepublic of Korea and collaborative, experimental studies are being\\nconducted to evaluate the viability and persistence of MERS-CoV on\\nsurfaces and in the air ( Bin et al., 2016 ;Kim et al., 2016a ;van\\nDoremalen et al., 2013 ). The role of mild or asymptomatic cases intransmission chains, however, remains unclear ( Omrani et al., 2013;\\nMemish et al., 2014c ;Al-Gethamy et al., 2015 ;Moon and Son, 2017 ;Al-\\nAbdely et al., 2018), warranting targeted epidemiological and clinical\\nstudies to be conducted among contacts during outbreaks, especially in\\nhealth care facilities.\\nCountries which have reported health care-associated outbreaks\\nhave implemented a variety of strategies to improve infection preven-\\ntion and control and reduce human-to-human transmission in hospitals,\\nincluding the introduction of a visual triage system prior to entrance to\\nthe emergency departments, the restructure of emergency department\\nlayouts for better triage of patients with respiratory symptoms, the\\nstandardization and training and re-training of infection prevention and\\ncontrol practices at facilities with high hospital sta ﬀturnover, and the\\nauditing of\\nhealth care facilities for adherence to infection prevention\\nand control measures.\\niii. Product research and development needs: Clinical management,\\ndiagnostics and medical interventions\\nThe WHO R&D Blueprint, a global strategy and preparedness plan\\nthat allows the rapid activation of R&D of epidemic pathogens, aims to\\nfast-track the development and use of e ﬀective point-of-care diagnostic\\ntests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avertlarge scale crises. Since 2015, MERS-CoV has been included in the\\nannual WHO R&D Blueprint list of prioritized pathogens for accelerated\\nresearch and development on diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics\\n(World Health Organization ). In addition, MERS-CoV has a speci ﬁc\\nroadmap for product research and development, outlined by WHO in\\nFig. 1. MERS-CoV transmission and geographic range. Countries highlighted in red and orange indicate the geographic range of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels.\\nThose in red have had documented spillover (camel-to-human) transmission with subsequent human-to-human transmission. Countries in blue are those with\\nreported human-to-human transmission. (Source: WHO).

Recent updates on product research and\\ndevelopment, presented at the Global Technical Meeting, are below.\\n2.1. Diagnostics\\nThe nonspeci ﬁc, and sometimes unusual, clinical presentation of\\nMERS in humans, makes early diagnosis di ﬃcult in health care facil-\\nities. While several highly speci ﬁc and sensitive molecular and serologic\\nassays exist for diagnosis in animals and humans ( Drosten et al., 2014;\\nCorman et al., 2012a ,2012b ;Lu et al., 2014 ;Perera et al., 2013a ;\\nReusken et al., 2013b; Müller et al., 2015 ;Song et al., 2015 ), there was\\na clear call from representatives from a ﬀected countries for the devel-\\nopment of a rapid diagnostic test to improve identi ﬁcation and isolation\\nof primary human cases in health care facilities. A full landscape ana-\\nlysis of MERS-CoV diagnostics will be published separately (Van Ker-\\nkhove, personal communication).\\n2.1.1. Therapeutics\\nAt the Global Technical Meeting, several therapeutics (including\\nconvalescent plasma, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, interferon and\\nnovel therapies including polyclonal antibodies and broad-spectrum\\nantivirals) in development were presented. However, small case num-\\nbers make the evaluation of their impact on morbidity and mortality\\nfrom MERS-CoV infection di ﬃcult ( Arabi et al., 2017a ;Arabi et al.,\\n2017b ;Arabi et al. ;Al-Dorzi et al., 2016 ;Sheahan et al., 2017 ;Ko et al.,\\n2018 ;Arabi et al., 2017c ). Several pre-clinical and phase I-III studies\\nare under way or in the design phase (outlined by the WHO R&DBlueprint: http://who-blueprint-mapping-tool.surge.sh/ ). WHO is cur-\\nrently evaluating all available evidence on therapeutics to update gui-dance on clinical management of patients and in the process to develop\\nstandardized clinical trial protocols that could be used in a ﬀected\\ncountries to evaluate promising therapeutic candidates.2.2. Vaccines for humans\\nWHO has identi ﬁed target product pro ﬁles for MERS-CoV vaccines\\nwhich include a dromedary camel vaccine for the reduction of zoonotictransmission, a human vaccine for long term protection of high risk\\nindividuals, such as those working with infected dromedary camels or\\nhealth care workers, and a human vaccine for reactive use in outbreak\\nsettings ( World Health Organization, 2017b ).\\nCurrently, no MERS-CoV-speci ﬁc or licensed human vaccines are\\navailable ( Modjarrad et al., 2016; World Health Organization, 2017c ).\\nSeveral human vaccine candidates for coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, are at various stages of development and ﬁve general vaccine\\ntechnology platforms have been developed and target the MERS-CoV\\nspike protein ( Modjarrad et\\n al., 2016 ;Okba et al., 2017 ). WHO, the\\nMinistry of Health in KSA and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI)have continued to further align e ﬀorts to develop coronavirus vaccines\\n(Excler et al., 2016) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and\\nInnovation (CEPI) has included MERS-CoV as one of three priority\\npathogens for ﬁnancing of a human vaccine. Understanding correlates\\nfor protection and having a reliable animal model remain essential forevaluating coronavirus vaccine candidates, including MERS-CoV.\\n2.3. Vaccines for camels\\nThere was a clear call from Global Technical Meeting participants to\\naccelerate the development of a dromedary camel vaccine in order to\\nevaluate the potential to reduce spillover transmission to humans. The\\nacceptability, cost-e ﬀectiveness and feasibility of a dromedary camel\\nvaccine will also need to be evaluated and compared to other inter-\\nvention strategies, such as human vaccination of high risk groups (e.g.,\\nthose with occupational exposure). Because MERS-CoV is endemic in\\ndromedary camel populations in the Middle East and elsewhere, mul-\\ntiple intervention strategies, including personal protective measures\\nand the strategic implementation of a camel vaccine, are likely needed\\nto reduce transmission from dromedary camels to humans.Table 1 (continued )\\nCountry Number of\\ncamelsEvidence of MERS-CoV infection\\nQatar 14 3 (21.4%) nasal samples were positive using RT-PCR ( Haagmans et al., 2014 )\\n105 62 (59.0%) camels showed evidence for virus shedding in at least one type of\\nswab at the time of slaughter ( Farag et al., 2015 )\\nAntibodies to MERS-CoV S1 were found in 100 of 103 (97.1%) dromedary camels\\ntested by micro-array technology ( Farag et al., 2015 )\\n53 1 (1.9%) nasal swab had full viral genome isolated ( Raj et al., 2014 )\\n33 7 (21.1%) showed evidence for active virus shedding and 5 (15.2%) had viralRNA in camel milk ( Reusken et al., 2014 )\\n10 9 (90%) sera samples had MERS-CoV –speciﬁc antibodies.

Aguanno et al. Antiviral Research 159 (2018) 35–44\\n40At least two promising camel vaccine candidates are currently in\\ndevelopment and being evaluated in ﬁeld trials ( Haagmans et al., 2016;\\nAlharbi et al., 2017 ). Stakeholders agreed that the current funding\\nmechanisms need to include risk-mitigating options that target the\\nanimal-human interface to prevent zoonotic transmission. These\\nfunding pathways would enable the development of camel vaccine\\ncandidates. Stakeholders also agreed that prior to camel vaccine im-\\nplementation, consultation with camel owners and government agen-\\ncies, feasibility studies including exploring opportunities for commer-\\ncial manufacturing and incentives for camel vaccination and an\\nassessment of potential trade implications, would all be critical.\\nIn June 2018, WHO and the International Vaccine Institut (IVI) held a\\njoint workshop update the status of human and animal MERS-CoV vaccine\\ndevelopment, and identify and prioritize activities to accelerate vaccine\\nresearch and development. The meeting was held in Seoul, Korea on\\n26–27 June and included 120 experts and professionals from industry,\\nacademia, international organizations and government agencies aroundthe world, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations\\n(CEPI), the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS) and the\\nKorea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).\\n3. The way forward\\nThe Global Technical Meeting served as an opportunity to review\\nthe available evidence and best practices for control of this epidemic\\nthreat six years after the virus was ﬁrst detected in humans. This cov-\\nered our understanding of the virus, our ability to detect and respond tocases in animal and human populations, how we communicate our\\nﬁndings and how our work impacts policy decisions to protect animals\\nand prevent human infections.\\nDuring the Global Technical Meeting, the latest ﬁndings from sci-\\nentiﬁc studies and knowledge gained from collaborative research and\\nsurveillance were shared across animal, environmental and humansectors. FAO, OIE and WHO strongly believe that to e ﬀectively address\\nzoonoses, including MERS-CoV, a One Health approach to prevent,detect, contain, eliminate and respond to animal and public health risks\\nfrom zoonotic high threat respiratory pathogens such as MERS-CoV and\\nshould involve all relevant sectors, the public and animal health and\\nacademic research community, industry and a ﬀected communities. We\\nacknowledged the progress that has been made, and importantly, dis-cussed the challenges that need to be addressed so that we can mini-\\nmize the future public health and economic impacts of this epidemic\\nprone virus. Our aim was to articulate a clear action plan to address\\nthese remaining unknowns and to foster better collaboration between\\nsectors and with subject matter experts willing to support member\\nstates.\\nGiven the marked expansion in research related to MERS-CoV con-\\nducted in the past two years, FAO, OIE and WHO agree that global sur-\\nveillance and research activities must now be focused on achieving the\\nfollowing major public health goals: reducing zoonotic transmission, de-\\ntecting and identifying suspected cases early, providing safe and e ﬀective\\ntreatment to reduce human morbidity and mortality, and signi ﬁcantly\\nreducing human-to-human transmission in health care settings.\\nThe critical needs for research and technical guidance identi ﬁed\\nduring the Global Technical Meeting have been used to inform the\\nWHO R&D MERS-CoV Roadmap ( Modjarrad et al., 2016 ) and a broader\\nResearch Agenda for MERS-CoV and other high threat coronaviruses.This research agenda serves as a catalyst to focus, align and mobilize\\npartners to address outstanding knowledge gaps in relation to MERS-\\nCoV across ﬁve technical areas:\\ni) virus origin and characteristics,\\nii) epidemiology and transmission,\\niii) clinical management and infection prevention and control,\\niv) product development and implementation ( Modjarrad et al., 2016 )\\nandv) impact of interventions and operational research. The meeting\\nidentiﬁed a large number of remaining priorities and the organizing\\ncommittee has summarized the main research needs in Table 2.\\nNow is the time to devote more e ﬀort to long term planning for\\nMERS-CoV.\\nWe believe more focused e ﬀorts in our activities and in-\\nvestments to address scienti ﬁc and public health research questions,\\naccelerate promising medical interventions and are more strategic onwhere activities are conducted globally will go further to address re-\\nmaining public health unknowns. While there have been improvements\\nin the ability to prevent human-to-human transmission once a MERS\\ncase is identi ﬁed, these are not su ﬃcient to prevent a large event with\\nsubstantial public health and economic consequences.\\nCompeting ﬁnancial interests\\nThe authors have no competing ﬁnancial interests.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe gratefully acknowledge the input from all those who attended\\nthe FAO-OIE-WHO Global Technical Meeting on MERS-CoV in\\nSeptember 2017.

The meeting reviewed the latest scienti ﬁcﬁndings and identi ﬁed and prioritized the global activities necessary to prevent, manage and control the disease. Critical needs for research and technical guidance identi ﬁed during the meeting have been used to update the WHO R&D MERS-CoV Roadmap for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines and a broader public health research agenda. Since the 2017 meeting, progress has been made on several key actions in animal populations, at the animal/human interface and in human populations. This report also summarizes thelatest scienti ﬁc studies on MERS since 2017, including data from more than 50 research studies examining the presence of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels. 1. Background: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Since its identi ﬁcation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) ( Zaki et al., 2012 ) and Jordan ( Hijawi et al., 2013 ) in 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has become a global public health threat. Typical of an emerging zoonosis, Middle East respiratory syn- drome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has an animal reservoir, i.e. dromedary camels in which the virus causes little to no disease ( Mohd et al., 2016 ). Many details about the extent of circulation and the mechanisms oftransmission within dromedary camel herds, or factors related to zoo- notic transmission and di ﬀerences in circulating MERS-CoV strains, remain unknown. The virus has repeatedly spilled over from dromedary camels to humans, principally in countries on the Arabian Peninsula, causing signi ﬁcant morbidity and mortality ( World Health Organization, 2017a ;Azhar et al., 2014 ). Clusters of cases in the community and among family members are rare ( World Health Organization, 2017a ;Drosten et al., 2014 ). However, delays in diag- nosis in hospitals has sometimes led to secondary cases among health care workers, patients sharing rooms or family members as a result ofunprotected direct contact with a patient before isolation. This human-to-human transmission in health care facilities can sometimes be am- pliﬁed, causing very large outbreaks, as has been seen in the Middle East and in the Republic of Korea, with signi ﬁcant public health and economic impacts ( Hijawi et al., 2013; Assiri et al., 2013 ;Al-Abdallat et al., 2014; Drosten et al., 2015 ;Al Hosani et al., 2016; Ki, 2015 ;Park et al., 2015 ). As of',\n"," 'August 2018, more than 2249 human cases from 27 countries have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization, 2017a ). The FAO, OIE and WHO Tripartite have regularly brought together aﬀected member states, public health and animal o ﬃcials, and aca- demics to discuss what is known and unknown about the zoonotic origin of MERS-CoV ( World Health Organization, 2016 ;FAO, 2016, 2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2013a ). The purposes of these meetings and workshops have been to advocate for more surveillance and research on MERS-CoV in animals and humans, to share information about how MERS-CoV is transmitted between animals, from animals to humans and between humans, to describe the diseases it causes, and to develop policies and guidelines for detection, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.09.002 Received 30 August 2018; Accepted 4 September 2018∗Corresponding author.

Treporting of animal and human infections, and prevention of human cases and clusters. In the two years since the last international technical consultation on MERS-CoV in 201613, there have been notable improvements in surveillance and reporting of human cases, multidisciplinary research,cross-sectoral collaboration at country level, public awareness about the disease, and laboratory and surveillance capacity in a ﬀected countries. In addition, a number of countries in the Arabian Peninsulaand in Africa have engaged in research activities and surveillance of camel populations to shed light on the wider distribution of this virus or investigate transmission patterns and routes for viral shedding. As a follow-up to previous meetings ( World Health Organization, 2016; FAO, 2016 ,2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2013b, 2013c ), FAO, OIE and WHO Tripartite held a Global Technical Meeting on MERS-CoV with representatives from Ministries of Health and Ministries of Agriculture, subject matter experts, researchers, funders and industrial partners from 25 to 27 September 2017 in Geneva, Switzerland (see Supplementary Information )(World Health Organization et al., 2017). The objectives were to review the latestscienti ﬁc evidence on MERS-CoV, further enhance cross-sectoral colla- boration and communication during preparedness and response activ-ities, and identify research priorities given the advancements in our knowledge. With 130 participants, this was the largest MERS-CoV Technical Meeting to date and the ﬁrst meeting attended by representatives from both a ﬀected and at risk countries. That is, countries which have re- ported human infection, countries with evidence of MERS-CoV in dro- medary camels but no reported human cases, and countries at risk for importation (countries without infected camels that have close ties to aﬀected countries through expatriate workers, travel to a ﬀected coun- tries for medical procedures and/or frequent international travel). 2. Findings from the global technical meeting There is strong consensus among all',\n"," 'stakeholders that dromedary camels are the main source of transmission to humans. In 2014, OIE identiﬁed MERS-CoV as an emerging disease with zoonotic potential in camels and thereby creating expectations of reporting positive camelsby countries ( OIE, 2014a ) and recently published a MERS-CoV case deﬁnition ( OIE, 2017) for the reporting of con ﬁrmed and suspected infection in camels. Not all countries face the same risks. For example, countries that have the infected reservoir (dromedary camels) di ﬀer from those countries in which dromedary camels show no evidence of current orpast infection ( Fig. 1). There may also be di ﬀerences in spillover po- tential in countries with documented zoonotic transmission, comparedto those without, due to several factors including potential di ﬀerences in husbandry practices, cultural, social, medicinal, occupational ex-posures, prevalence of underlying chronic medical conditions, or ge- netic factors in human populations, and MERS-CoV viral di ﬀerences (Wong et al., 2015 ). As such, technical and risk mitigation guidance to protect human health and research priorities di ﬀer by region. Theﬁndings from the Global Technical Meeting are summarized below: i. Surveillance needs: Surveillance in animals and humans to limit zoonotic transmission Routine human surveillance for MERS-CoV in KSA ( Abdulaziz et al., 2017 ) and throughout the Middle East has improved since the identi- ﬁcation of the virus in humans in 2012, but there is signi ﬁcant variation in the quality and extent of surveillance between countries. In otherparts of the world, surveillance is limited. Since it is known that MERS- CoV is enzootic in areas of Africa and Asia where dromedary camels are found, heighted awareness and surveillance for zoonotic MERS isrequired. This is currently lacking and remains a knowledge gap. One exception is the notable e ﬀort to identify potential MERS-CoV infection among pilgrims travelling back from the Middle East. Since2012, event-based surveillance among pilgrims returning from Hajj, Umrah and other religious events in KSA has been conducted by KSA and countries sending pilgrims. While many return reporting re- spiratory symptoms, no MERS-CoV infections have been identi ﬁed among returning pilgrims ( Muraduzzaman et al., 2018 ;Barasheed et al., 2014 ;Atabani et al., 2016; Koul et al., 2017; Annan et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2017 ;Memish et al., 2014a ,2014b ;Refaey et al., 2017; Al- Abdallat et al., 2017 ;Matthew et al., 2015 ;Alqahtani et al., 2016; Win et al., 2016 ;Yavarian et al., 2018; Kapoor et al., 2014 ). Among animals, ﬁeld surveys conducted to date have included several domestic and wildlife species including dromedary camels(Camelus dromedarius ) and Bactrian camels ( Camelus bactrianus ), goats, bats, cattle, sheep, chickens, swine, ducks, bu ﬀalo and equids. Field studies in dromedary camels have been conducted in a number of countries ( Table 1). To date, MERS-CoV RNA or MERS-CoV-speci ﬁc antibodies have been identi ﬁed in dromedary camels a number of countries ( Table 1) except Australia ( Hemida et al., 2014), Kazakhstan (Miguel et al., 2016 ), and the Netherlands ( Reusken et al.,',\n"," '2013a ). Other livestock such as alpacas ( Vicugna pacos ), llamas ( Llama pacos ), young goats, rabbits and pigs have been shown to be susceptible to experimental infection ( Crameri et al., 2016 ;Adney et al., 2016; Vergara-Alert et al., 2017). Despite improvements, routine surveillance in dromedary popula- tions is limited. The lack of surveillance information about MERS-CoVcirculation in dromedary camels restricts our understanding of the transmission dynamics and epidemiology in dromedary camel popula- tions. Meeting participants agreed that surveillance should be in- tegrated into existing surveillance systems, particularly in at-risk countries, similar to One Health approaches developed for avian in- ﬂuenza, and existing human respiratory disease surveillance systems set up for in ﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Currently, a limitation in our ability to mitigate spillover from dromedary camels to humans is a lack of clarity on the mode(s) oftransmission between dromedary camels and humans, the extent and epidemiology of MERS-CoV circulation in dromedary camels in large parts of Africa and South Asia, and on why zoonotic transmission is limited across Africa, large parts of the Middle East, and some parts of South Asia despite high seroprevalence in dromedary camels ( Chu et al., 2018 )(Table 1). FAO has outlined the meeting participants conclusions on priorities for MERS-CoV surveillance and management of PCR positive dro-medary camels, coordinated outbreak investigation of community ac- quired cases with dromedary exposure, testing of animals at quarantine and entry points, food safety and environmental contamination, risk communication and awareness raising for MERS-CoV among animal owners and intersectoral collaboration and coordination in an updated Doha Declaration ﬁrst published in 2015 ( FAO, 2015 ) (REF/hyperlink). In dromedary camels, longitudinal studies to evaluate the natural his-tory, shedding pro ﬁle and immunity were highlighted as key research priorities. Meeting participants agreed that further understanding ofdiﬀerences in viral strains and transmission dynamics, including the role of immunity in acquiring infection and shedding virus, the geo-graphic range of spillover events, and environmental, behavioral or host-related risk factors for zoonotic transmission should be prioritized. ii. Research needs: Hospital transmission and infection prevention and control Countries face signi ﬁcant challenges in the early identi ﬁcation and diagnosis of MERS in humans due to the non-speci ﬁcity of clinical symptoms ( Arabi et al., 2017a ;TheS-Coesearch, 2013; Arabi et al., 2017b ;Al-Taw ﬁq et al., 2017; Al-Taw ﬁq and Hinedi, 2018 ;Hui et al., ).R. Aguanno et al. Antiviral Research 159 (2018) 35–44 36The spectrum of illness ranges from no symptoms (or asymptomatic infection) to severe disease including pneumonia, acute respiratory disease syndrome, organ failure and death, with a case fatality ratio 35.5% among reported cases ( World Health Organization, 2012). The delay in identi ﬁcation and recognition of signs and symptoms compa- tible with MERS and delay in early isolation of patients has reduced the ability to prevent transmission between people in health care settings, notably in emergency departments, cardiac care centers and renal dialysis units ( Hijawi et al., 2013 ;Assiri et al., 2013',\n"," ';Al-Abdallat et al., 2014 ;Drosten et al., 2015 ;Al Hosani et al., 2016 ;Ki, 2015 ;Park et al., 2015 ;Ahmed et al., 2018; Amer et al., 2018). Our understanding of human-to-human transmission in health care settings has improved through experimental and observational studies conducted in countries during such outbreaks. For example, studies of respiratory pathogens ( Yu et al., 2007 ;Tran et al., 2012 ;Thompson et al., 2013) and MERS-CoV conducted in the Middle East ( Assiri et al., 2013 ;Oboho et al., 2015 ;Hunter et al., 2016; Balkhy et al., 2016 ) and the Republic of Korea ( Bin et al., 2016 ;Kim et al., 2016a ,2016b ;Nam et al., 2017) illustrate that aerosol-generating procedures and non-in- vasive ventilation, combined with inappropriate infection prevention and control practices and lack of adherence to standard practices had an important role in facilitating human-to-human transmission in health care settings. The role of environmental contamination has been evaluated in a number of hospitals following the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea and collaborative, experimental studies are being conducted to evaluate the viability and persistence of MERS-CoV on surfaces and in the air ( Bin et al., 2016 ;Kim et al., 2016a ;van Doremalen et al., 2013 ). The role of mild or asymptomatic cases intransmission chains, however, remains unclear ( Omrani et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2014c ;Al-Gethamy et al., 2015 ;Moon and Son, 2017 ;Al- Abdely et al., 2018), warranting targeted epidemiological and clinical studies to be conducted among contacts during outbreaks, especially in health care facilities. Countries which have reported health care-associated outbreaks have implemented a variety of strategies to improve infection preven- tion and control and reduce human-to-human transmission in hospitals, including the introduction of a visual triage system prior to entrance to the emergency departments, the restructure of emergency department layouts for better triage of patients with respiratory symptoms, the standardization and training and re-training of infection prevention and control practices at facilities with high hospital sta ﬀturnover, and the auditing of health care facilities for adherence to infection prevention and control measures. iii. Product research and development needs: Clinical management, diagnostics and medical interventions The WHO R&D Blueprint, a global strategy and preparedness plan that allows the rapid activation of R&D of epidemic pathogens, aims to fast-track the development and use of e ﬀective point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avertlarge scale crises. Since 2015, MERS-CoV has been included in the annual WHO R&D Blueprint list of prioritized pathogens for accelerated research and development on diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics (World Health Organization ). In addition, MERS-CoV has a speci ﬁc roadmap for product research and development, outlined by WHO in Fig. 1. MERS-CoV transmission and geographic range. Countries highlighted in red and orange indicate the geographic range of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels. Those in red have had documented spillover (camel-to-human) transmission with subsequent human-to-human transmission. Countries in blue are those with reported human-to-human transmission.

Recent updates on product research and development, presented at the Global Technical Meeting, are below. 2.1. Diagnostics The nonspeci ﬁc, and sometimes unusual, clinical presentation of MERS in humans, makes early diagnosis di ﬃcult in health care facil- ities. While several highly speci ﬁc and sensitive molecular and serologic assays exist for diagnosis in animals and humans ( Drosten et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2012a ,2012b ;Lu et al., 2014 ;Perera et al., 2013a ; Reusken et al., 2013b; Müller et al., 2015 ;Song et al., 2015 ), there was a clear call from representatives from a ﬀected countries for the devel- opment of a rapid diagnostic test to improve identi ﬁcation and isolation of primary human cases in health care facilities. A full landscape ana- lysis of MERS-CoV diagnostics will be',\n"," 'published separately (Van Ker- khove, personal communication). 2.1.1. Therapeutics At the Global Technical Meeting, several therapeutics (including convalescent plasma, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, interferon and novel therapies including polyclonal antibodies and broad-spectrum antivirals) in development were presented. However, small case num- bers make the evaluation of their impact on morbidity and mortality from MERS-CoV infection di ﬃcult ( Arabi et al., 2017a ;Arabi et al., 2017b ;Arabi et al. ;Al-Dorzi et al., 2016 ;Sheahan et al., 2017 ;Ko et al., 2018 ;Arabi et al., 2017c ). Several pre-clinical and phase I-III studies are under way or in the design phase (outlined by the WHO R&DBlueprint: http://who-blueprint-mapping-tool.surge.sh/ ). WHO is cur- rently evaluating all available evidence on therapeutics to update gui-dance on clinical management of patients and in the process to develop standardized clinical trial protocols that could be used in a ﬀected countries to evaluate promising therapeutic candidates.2.2. Vaccines for humans WHO has identi ﬁed target product pro ﬁles for MERS-CoV vaccines which include a dromedary camel vaccine for the reduction of zoonotictransmission, a human vaccine for long term protection of high risk individuals, such as those working with infected dromedary camels or health care workers, and a human vaccine for reactive use in outbreak settings ( World Health Organization, 2017b ). Currently, no MERS-CoV-speci ﬁc or licensed human vaccines are available ( Modjarrad et al., 2016; World Health Organization, 2017c ). Several human vaccine candidates for coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, are at various stages of development and ﬁve general vaccine technology platforms have been developed and target the MERS-CoV spike protein ( Modjarrad et al., 2016 ;Okba et al., 2017 ). WHO, the Ministry of Health in KSA and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI)have continued to further align e ﬀorts to develop coronavirus vaccines (Excler et al., 2016) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI) has included MERS-CoV as one of three priority pathogens for ﬁnancing of a human vaccine. Understanding correlates for protection and having a reliable animal model remain essential forevaluating coronavirus vaccine candidates, including MERS-CoV. 2.3. Vaccines for camels There was a clear call from Global Technical Meeting participants to accelerate the development of a dromedary camel vaccine in order to evaluate the potential to reduce spillover transmission to humans. The acceptability, cost-e ﬀectiveness and feasibility of a dromedary camel vaccine will also need to be evaluated and compared to other inter- vention strategies, such as human vaccination of high risk groups (e.g., those with occupational exposure). Because MERS-CoV is endemic in dromedary camel populations in the Middle East and elsewhere, mul- tiple intervention strategies, including personal protective measures and the strategic implementation of a camel vaccine, are likely needed to reduce transmission from dromedary camels to humans.Table 1 (continued ) Country Number of camelsEvidence of MERS-CoV infection Qatar 14 3 (21.4%) nasal samples were positive using RT-PCR ( Haagmans et al., 2014 ) 105 62 (59.0%) camels showed evidence for virus shedding in at least one type of swab at the time of slaughter ( Farag',\n"," 'et al., 2015 ) Antibodies to MERS-CoV S1 were found in 100 of 103 (97.1%) dromedary camels tested by micro-array technology ( Farag et al., 2015 ) 53 1 (1.9%) nasal swab had full viral genome isolated ( Raj et al., 2014 ) 33 7 (21.1%) showed evidence for active virus shedding and 5 (15.2%) had viralRNA in camel milk ( Reusken et al., 2014 ) 10 9 (90%) sera samples had MERS-CoV –speciﬁc antibodies. All nasal swab specimens were negative by PCR ( Chantal et al., 2016 ) Spain (Canary Islands) 105 15 (14%) had protein-speci ﬁc antibodies against MERS-CoV ( Reusken et al., 2013d ) Somalia 86 25 (87.5%) dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies using MN (Muller MA et al., 2014 ) Sudan 60 49 (81.7%) dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies using MN(Muller MA et al., 2014 ) Tunisia 204 Seropositivity was 30% for animals ≤2 years of age and 54% for adult dromedary camels ( Chantal et al., 2014 ) UAE 1113 42 (3.7%) nasal swabs yielded positive results ( Muhairi et al., 2016 ) 843 786 (93.2%) sera samples were positive for antibodies against MERS-CoV ( Sung Sup et al., 2015 ) 11 9 (81.8%) sera samples were positive for antibodies supported by similar resultsin a MERS-CoV recombinant partial spike protein antibody ELISA ( Alexandersen et al., 2014 ) 651 632 (97.1%) had antibodies against MERS-CoV ( Meyer et al., 2014 ) 376 108 (28.7%) nasopharyngeal samples positive for MERS-CoV ( Li et al., 2017 ) 254 234 (92.1%) sera samples were positive for MERS-CoV IgG ( Sung Sup et al., 2015 ) 6 6 (100%) nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive for MERS-CoV ( Paden et al., 2018 )R.

Aguanno et al. Antiviral Research 159 (2018) 35–44 40At least two promising camel vaccine candidates are currently in development and being evaluated in ﬁeld trials ( Haagmans et al., 2016; Alharbi et al., 2017 ). Stakeholders agreed that the current funding mechanisms need to include risk-mitigating options that target the animal-human interface to prevent zoonotic transmission. These funding pathways would enable the development of',\n"," 'camel vaccine candidates. Stakeholders also agreed that prior to camel vaccine im- plementation, consultation with camel owners and government agen- cies, feasibility studies including exploring opportunities for commer- cial manufacturing and incentives for camel vaccination and an assessment of potential trade implications, would all be critical. In June 2018, WHO and the International Vaccine Institut (IVI) held a joint workshop update the status of human and animal MERS-CoV vaccine development, and identify and prioritize activities to accelerate vaccine research and development. The meeting was held in Seoul, Korea on 26–27 June and included 120 experts and professionals from industry, academia, international organizations and government agencies aroundthe world, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS) and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). 3. The way forward The Global Technical Meeting served as an opportunity to review the available evidence and best practices for control of this epidemic threat six years after the virus was ﬁrst detected in humans. This cov- ered our understanding of the virus, our ability to detect and respond tocases in animal and human populations, how we communicate our ﬁndings and how our work impacts policy decisions to protect animals and prevent human infections. During the Global Technical Meeting, the latest ﬁndings from sci- entiﬁc studies and knowledge gained from collaborative research and surveillance were shared across animal, environmental and humansectors. FAO, OIE and WHO strongly believe that to e ﬀectively address zoonoses, including MERS-CoV, a One Health approach to prevent,detect, contain, eliminate and respond to animal and public health risks from zoonotic high threat respiratory pathogens such as MERS-CoV and should involve all relevant sectors, the public and animal health and academic research community, industry and a ﬀected communities. We acknowledged the progress that has been made, and importantly, dis-cussed the challenges that need to be addressed so that we can mini- mize the future public health and economic impacts of this epidemic prone virus. Our aim was to articulate a clear action plan to address these remaining unknowns and to foster better collaboration between sectors and with subject matter experts willing to support member states. Given the marked expansion in research related to MERS-CoV con- ducted in the past two years, FAO, OIE and WHO agree that global sur- veillance and research activities must now be focused on achieving the following major public health goals: reducing zoonotic transmission, de- tecting and identifying suspected cases early, providing safe and e ﬀective treatment to reduce human morbidity and mortality, and signi ﬁcantly reducing human-to-human transmission in health care settings. The critical needs for research and technical guidance identi ﬁed during the Global Technical Meeting have been used to inform the WHO R&D MERS-CoV Roadmap ( Modjarrad et al., 2016 ) and a broader Research Agenda for MERS-CoV and other high threat coronaviruses.This research agenda serves as a catalyst to focus, align and mobilize partners to address outstanding knowledge gaps in relation to MERS- CoV across',\n"," 'ﬁve technical areas: i) virus origin and characteristics, ii) epidemiology and transmission, iii) clinical management and infection prevention and control, iv) product development and implementation ( Modjarrad et al., 2016 ) andv) impact of interventions and operational research. The meeting identiﬁed a large number of remaining priorities and the organizing committee has summarized the main research needs in Table 2. Now is the time to devote more e ﬀort to long term planning for MERS-CoV. We believe more focused e ﬀorts in our activities and in- vestments to address scienti ﬁc and public health research questions, accelerate promising medical interventions and are more strategic onwhere activities are conducted globally will go further to address re- maining public health unknowns. While there have been improvements in the ability to prevent human-to-human transmission once a MERS case is identi ﬁed, these are not su ﬃcient to prevent a large event with substantial public health and economic consequences.

The FAO, OIE and WHO Tripartite have regularly brought together aﬀected member states, public health and animal o ﬃcials, and aca- demics to discuss what is known and unknown about the zoonotic origin of MERS-CoV ( World Health Organization, 2016 ;FAO, 2016, 2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2013a ). The purposes of these meetings and workshops have been to advocate for more surveillance and research on MERS-CoV in animals and humans, to share information about how MERS-CoV is transmitted between animals, from animals to humans and between humans, to describe the diseases it causes, and to develop policies and guidelines for detection, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.09.002 Received 30 August 2018; Accepted 4 September 2018∗Corresponding author.

Treporting of animal and human infections, and prevention of human cases and clusters. In the two years since the last international technical consultation on MERS-CoV in 201613, there have been notable improvements in surveillance and reporting of human cases, multidisciplinary research,cross-sectoral collaboration at country level, public awareness about the disease, and laboratory and surveillance capacity in a ﬀected countries. In addition, a number of countries in the Arabian Peninsulaand in Africa have engaged in research activities and surveillance of camel populations to shed light on the wider distribution of this virus or investigate transmission patterns and routes for viral shedding. As a follow-up to previous meetings ( World Health Organization, 2016; FAO, 2016 ,2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2014 ;WHO Regional o ﬃce for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2013b, 2013c ), FAO, OIE and WHO Tripartite held a Global Technical Meeting on MERS-CoV with representatives from Ministries of Health and Ministries of Agriculture, subject matter experts, researchers, funders and industrial partners from 25 to 27 September 2017 in Geneva, Switzerland (see Supplementary Information )(World Health Organization et al., 2017). The objectives were to review the latestscienti ﬁc evidence on MERS-CoV, further enhance cross-sectoral colla- boration and communication during preparedness and response activ-ities, and identify research priorities given the advancements in our knowledge. With 130 participants, this was the largest MERS-CoV Technical Meeting to date and the ﬁrst meeting attended by representatives from both a ﬀected and at risk countries. That is, countries which have re- ported human infection, countries with evidence of MERS-CoV in dro- medary camels but no reported human cases, and countries at risk for importation (countries without infected camels that have close ties to aﬀected countries through expatriate workers, travel to a ﬀected coun- tries for medical procedures and/or frequent international travel). 2.

The meeting identiﬁed a large number of remaining priorities and the organizing committee has summarized the main research needs in Table 2. Now is the time to devote more e ﬀort to long term planning for MERS-CoV. We believe more focused e ﬀorts in our activities and in- vestments to address scienti ﬁc and public health research questions, accelerate promising medical interventions and are more strategic onwhere activities are conducted globally will go further to address re- maining public health unknowns. While there have been improvements in the ability to prevent human-to-human transmission once a MERS case is identi ﬁed, these are not su ﬃcient to prevent a large event with substantial public health and economic consequences.

In 2014, OIE identiﬁed MERS-CoV as an emerging disease with zoonotic potential in camels and thereby creating expectations of reporting positive camelsby countries ( OIE, 2014a ) and recently published a MERS-CoV case deﬁnition ( OIE, 2017) for the reporting of con ﬁrmed and suspected infection in camels. Not all countries face the same risks. For example, countries that have the infected reservoir (dromedary camels) di ﬀer from those countries in which dromedary camels show no evidence of current orpast infection ( Fig. 1). There may also be di ﬀerences in spillover po- tential in countries with documented zoonotic transmission, comparedto those without, due to several factors including potential di ﬀerences in husbandry practices, cultural, social, medicinal, occupational ex-posures, prevalence of underlying chronic medical conditions, or ge- netic factors in human populations, and MERS-CoV viral di ﬀerences (Wong et al., 2015 ). As such, technical and risk mitigation guidance to protect human health and research priorities di ﬀer by region. Theﬁndings from the Global Technical Meeting are summarized below: i. Surveillance needs: Surveillance in animals and humans to limit zoonotic transmission Routine human surveillance for MERS-CoV in KSA ( Abdulaziz et al., 2017 ) and throughout the Middle East has improved since the identi- ﬁcation of the virus in humans in 2012, but there is signi ﬁcant variation in the quality and extent of surveillance between countries. In otherparts of the world, surveillance is limited. Since it is known that MERS- CoV is enzootic in areas of Africa and Asia where dromedary camels are found, heighted awareness and surveillance for zoonotic MERS isrequired. This is currently lacking and remains a knowledge gap. One exception is the notable e ﬀort to identify potential MERS-CoV infection among pilgrims travelling back from the Middle East. Since2012, event-based surveillance among pilgrims returning from Hajj, Umrah and other religious events in KSA has been conducted by KSA and countries sending pilgrims. While many return reporting re- spiratory symptoms, no MERS-CoV infections have been identi ﬁed among returning pilgrims ( Muraduzzaman et al., 2018 ;Barasheed et al., 2014 ;Atabani et al., 2016; Koul et al., 2017; Annan et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2017 ;Memish et al., 2014a ,2014b ;Refaey et al., 2017; Al- Abdallat et al., 2017 ;Matthew et al., 2015 ;Alqahtani et al., 2016; Win et al., 2016 ;Yavarian et al., 2018; Kapoor et al., 2014 ).
